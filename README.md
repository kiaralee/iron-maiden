untitled 2017/18 school assignment in VB.<br><br>

Play as a teenage babysitter in the 1980s in this text based maze game! The child has staged an elaborate game of hide and seek, leaving clues all around the house. Your task is to successfully find the child before the parents come home! Fail, and you will be remembered as not only a terrible babysitter, but as the only self-respecting punk teenager in town who couldn't afford tickets to Iron Maiden. Good luck!<br><br>
